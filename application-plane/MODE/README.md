# MODE Mobility Detector Algorithm

The novel **Mobility Detection (MODE)** algorithm taking advantage of the SD-MIoT centralized approach, passively detects moving network nodes. In detail, it applies data analysis and classification methods (i.e., the well-known K-means algorithm) on adjacent matrices generated from the network's connectivity graph, to dynamically draw accurate conclusions about the network nodes' mobility behavior (i.e., which nodes are moving and which are static at the current time). The algorithm operates at the application plane; as such, its outcome apart of an essential input for our MCC mechanisms can be further used from third-party IoT applications or other SDN controllers. To our knowledge, MODE is the first attempt towards the design, implementation, and operation of a smart decision-making algorithm that passively detects the network's mobility behavior utilizing an SDN based network framework. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it uses the complete picture of the network rather than only a node or part of it.
